# BMI-Calculator

Body Mass Index(BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.

The forumula of the BMI can be represented as BMI = Weight(kg)/(Height*Height)(m*m)

It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. And based on the output a person can be categorized as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range of the value.

Below is the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended body weight based on BMI values for adults. It is used for both men and women, age 20 or older.

 
Category	BMI range - kg/m2
1. Severe Thinness	< 16
2. Moderate Thinness	16 - 17
3. Mild Thinness	17 - 18.5
4. Normal	18.5 - 25
5. Overweight	25 - 30
6. Obese Class I	30 - 35
7. Obese Class II	35 - 40
8. Obese Class III	> 40


Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Although BMI cannot be fully accurate and can be influenced by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass, body fat, and activity level etc.

# What was done?

1. 3 inputs from the users: Name, Height(m), Weight(Kg)
2. Used Exception Handling to avoid invalid data
3. Calculated the BMI from the formula provided in the link (https://www.calculator.net/bmi-calculator.html)
4. The program deduces the range in which the BMI lies.
